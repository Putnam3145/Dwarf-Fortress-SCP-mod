[TITLE]A Foundation Site[/TITLE]
[P]You have arrived. When the O5s decided that you and 6 other 
foundation members were going to embark into the
forbidding wilderness beyond, you thought they were insane.
Doesn't the [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURCIV] have effectively 
infinite supply? The answer, of course, is no. Thus you've
set off, and you're finally here.
[P]There are almost no supplies left, but...
hey, you read the survival manuals. Just follow your directions
and you may get through this. I mean, you've heard
about all of the [VAR:NAME_PLURAL:GLOBAL:LOCAL_LARGE_PREDATOR] around here, but...
that's nothing to worry about, right?
A new tale of the Foundation's efforts begin here at this place, [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT], "[VAR:TRANSLATEDNAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT]". Get to it!
